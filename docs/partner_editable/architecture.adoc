Figure 1: Quick Start architecture for OpenEdge on AWS

The Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets:

** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.

* In the private subnets:

** EC2 instances running a Web Server in an Auto Scaling group.
** EC2 instances running PAS for OpenEdge in an Auto Scaling group.
** Three EC2 instances running OpenEdge RDBMS with support for replication sets.
