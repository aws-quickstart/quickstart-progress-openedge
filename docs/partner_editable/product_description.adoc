Progress OpenEdge on AWS is a convenient way to create the infrastructure required to run an n-tier OpenEdge Advanced Business Language (ABL) application with a web user interface (UI), representational state transfer (REST) data services, and the OpenEdge database. It combines AWS services and OpenEdge functionality to achieve high availability, redundancy, and scalability.

You can use the Quick Start CloudFormation template interactively to create a new infrastructure or use the CloudFormation CLI to automate deployments of OpenEdge applications from a CI/CD pipeline.

The template uses user-provided deployment packages for the web server, Progress Application Server (PAS) for the OpenEdge application, and OpenEdge Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for the OpenEdge database. You can package your on-premises application using this approach to deploy it to the AWS Cloud.

The web server and PAS for OpenEdge dynamically download and install the latest version of the package when Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances are created. This can be used to roll out new versions of the application if desired. The configuration for the database can use OpenEdge replication sets to provide redundancy.
